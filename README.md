# Emoji-Dictionary-React-App
We make a react app which is based on the the Emoji Dictionary. If anyone want to use a emoji but they don't know the meaning of the emoji so for those persons this react app is made.
If we click on emoji then it gives its name and meaning of emoji or put the emoji in search area so by this also we can know the name and meaning of the emoji. In this we have limited emoji's but 
we can add more data easily.
